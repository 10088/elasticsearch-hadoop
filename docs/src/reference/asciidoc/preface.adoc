== About {eh}

{eh} is a stand-alone, self-contained, small library that allows Hadoop jobs (whether using {mr} or libraries built upon it such as Hive, Pig or Cascading) to 'interact' with {es}.
Data flows 'bi-directionaly' so that applications can leverage transparently the {es} engine capabilities to significantly enrich their capabilities and increase the performance.
{eh} offers first-class support for vanilla {mr}, Cascading, Pig and Hive so that using {es} is literally like using resources within the Hadoop cluster.
